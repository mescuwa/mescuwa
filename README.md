# Lumina Mescuwa | AI Systems Architect & Independent Researcher

<p align="center">
  <em>Architecting the next generation of intelligent systems by bridging the gap between high-level vision and robust, first-principles engineering. I build autonomous agents, novel neural architectures, and the tools to power them.</em>

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Currently Focused On

I am currently executing **Protocol Sephron**, a self-designed, intensive roadmap to deepen my foundational expertise and bring my architectural visions to life. My primary objectives are:

- **Achieving mastery** in Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, and the core mathematics of AI.
- **Refining my flagship projects** into robust, well-documented, and impactful systems.

### Key Projects & Research

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **[Prometheus](https://github.com/mescuwa/project-prometheus)** | An autonomous AI scientist that replicates the scientific method. Architected a multi-agent system that performed research, experimentation, and discovered a novel molecule with a superior composite score. |
| **[Epsilon](https://github.com/mescuwa/epsilon)** | A novel Transformer architecture that outperforms a baseline by **~5% in accuracy** and **1.5x in speedup**. Features a sub-quadratic attention mechanism (HQSA) and is detailed in a full technical whitepaper. |
| **[CodeTag](https://github.com/mescuwa/codetag)** | A professional-grade developer tool (TUI/CLI) for codebase analysis and LLM context-packing. Packaged via `pipx` and integrated with security scanners like Semgrep & OSV-Scanner. |
| **[The Apollyon Benchmark](https://github.com/mescuwa/ASI-Benchmark)** | An open-source benchmark designed to test the limits of logical reasoning and systems thinking in state-of-the-art LLMs. |
